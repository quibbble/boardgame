## Objective 🎯
The goal of Tsuro is to be the last player with your game token on the board.

## Components 🧱
- A 6 x 6 tiled game board.
- 35 Path Tiles with different paths.
- 2 to 8 different colored tokens, one for each player.
- A special Dragon Tile.

## Setting Up 🏗️
1. Put the game board in the middle of the table.
2. Everyone picks a token and puts it on a starting point on the edge of the board.
3. Create a draw pile from the 35 Path Tiles.
4. Each player draws three random Path Tiles to start, and the youngest player goes first.
5. Play continues clockwise around the board.

## How to Play 🚀
Here's what you do on your turn:

1. **Play a Path Tile:** Choose one of your Path Tiles and put it on the board. Connect it to where your token is now.

2. **Move the Token(s):** After placing your Path Tile, follow the path you made with it, and move your token along that path. Move any other player's token that also connects to the Path Tile you placed.

3. **Watch for Collisions:** If your token collides another player's token you both are out of the game. Any token that goes off the board is also out of the game!

4. **Get a New Path Tile:** When you're done, take another Path Tile to keep three in your hand. If you are out of the game then instead shuffle your tiles back into the draw pile.

5. **Dragon Tile**: If the draw pile is empty but you need to draw then take the dragon tile. The next time tiles are available, the player with the Dragon Tile draws first. In clockwise order, players continue to take turns drawing tiles until either all active players have 3 tiles or the draw pile is empty. 

## How to Win 🏆
Keep playing until only one player's token is left on the board. That player wins!

## Extra Rules 🤨
- Path's that cross do not count as a collision. Only when tokens end up on the same path do they collide.
- You must place your Path Tile adjacent to your token. 
- If everyone gets out at the same time, the game is a tie.
  
## Variations 📍

- **Classic**: Standard Tsuro.
- **Longest Path**: At the end of the game the player with the longest path wins!
- **Most Crossings**: At the end of the game the player whose path crosses itself the most wins!
- **Open Tiles**: Players place Path Tiles from a common hand of 3 tiles.
- **Solo**: Place all the Path Tiles while keeping every token from colliding or going off the board.
